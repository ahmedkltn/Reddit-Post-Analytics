# Reddit Post Analytics

## Project Overview

The Reddit Post Analytics project aims to provide users with valuable insights and visualizations for a given Reddit post. By entering the URL of a specific Reddit post, users will be able to analyze the post's comments, extract key information, and generate visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the post's engagement and the sentiments expressed by the community.

The project includes functionalities such as Reddit post data retrieval, data preprocessing, word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, data visualization, and report generation. By leveraging these functionalities, users can explore the engagement level of a Reddit post, identify popular themes and topics, visualize sentiment trends, and generate informative reports summarizing the findings.

## Project Scope

The project scope includes the following functionalities:

1. Reddit Post Data Retrieval:
    - Retrieve relevant data from the Reddit API based on the provided post URL.
    - Handle authentication and API rate limits appropriately.
2. Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean and preprocess retrieved data by removing irrelevant characters, handling missing values, and tokenizing the text into individual words.
    - Apply text normalization techniques, such as stemming or lemmatization.
3. Word Frequency Analysis:
    - Calculate the frequency of each word used in the comments associated with the Reddit post.
    - Identify and display the most commonly used words to understand prevalent themes and topics.
4. Sentiment Analysis:
    - Perform sentiment analysis on the comments to determine the expressed sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) by the Reddit community.
    - Generate visualizations to illustrate the prevailing sentiments.
5. Data Visualization:
    - Utilize Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, or Seaborn to create informative and visually appealing visualizations.
    - Generate graphs, charts, and other visual representations of the analyzed data to highlight patterns, trends, and insights.
6. Report Generation:
    - Create a report summarizing the findings and insights derived from the Reddit post analysis.
    - Include visualizations, key metrics (word frequencies, sentiment analysis results), and relevant information to provide a comprehensive overview.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the Reddit Post Analytics project are:

1. Analyze Reddit Post Engagement:
    - Enable users to gain insights into the engagement level of a specific Reddit post by analyzing its comments and associated metrics.
2. Identify Popular Themes and Topics:
    - Identify the most commonly used words in the comments to determine the prevailing themes and topics discussed within the Reddit community.
3. Visualize Sentiment Trends:
    - Conduct sentiment analysis on the comments to understand the sentiments expressed by the Reddit community.
    - Generate visualizations that depict the sentiment distribution and highlight any sentiment trends over time.
4. Provide Informative Reports:
    - Generate comprehensive reports summarizing the findings and insights derived from the Reddit post analysis.
    - Present the reports in a clear, organized manner, making it easy for users to interpret the results.

By accomplishing these goals, the Reddit Post Analytics project aims to provide users with a better understanding of the engagement, sentiments, and prevailing topics within specific Reddit posts, facilitating informed decision-making and deeper community insights.
